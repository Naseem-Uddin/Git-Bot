This is a steamlit app built on python that basically works as a github repository helper. 
It takes in the github repo URL and is able to answer questions and provide feedback to the user about pretty much anything that they are curious about within the repo.
The embedding method currently used is not the greatest and could definetly be modified but that is for the future.
